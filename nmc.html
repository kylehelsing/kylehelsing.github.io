        <p class="card-text">I chose to pursue the New Media Certificate because I felt it would be very beneficial to my degree as well as my professional development. <br>Being a computer science major, I was able to take the dev route and jump right in with Rich Media Production. This was the class that initially put my eyes on NMIX as I was very interested in getting my feet wet with iOS development. I thoroughly enjoyed the class and went on to use some of my acquired skills at my internship with Chick-Fil-A Corporate over the summer. <br>After 4310, I went on to take Digital Brown Bag where I was able to learn vital skills for both the workplace and adult life. Some of my big take-aways from that class include creating my own business card, understanding my credit score, and forming a new iteration of my resume. I am very excited for the next step in my journey: NMI Capstone.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Rich Media Production was my introduction into the New Media Institute. This class focuses on application development, with an emphasis on iOS development. <br>Having a history in software development benefitted me heavily in this course in terms of understanding object-oriented programming. We started semester learning Swift, but quickly switched over to SwiftUI upon release. Making the switch was tough, but very useful as SwiftUI had tons of added functionality including a live, interactive view of your application during development. <br>For my final project, I developed a weather app that used the DarkSky API to gather weather information. It then rendered this data into a list view as well as an individualized city view. Below is the demo for this project:</p>

        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Summary:</h6>
        <p class="card-text">Software Engineering is a computer science class that is being used as an elective for the NMIX certificate. This class explores the software design and lifecycle process through a semester long project. <br>Starting with eliciting project requirements, we walked through generating design documents and analyzing tools that would help with implementation. This class also explores system requirements and different kinds of system architecture including MVC. <br>Our term project was to create an online bookstore where users can create and manage accounts, have dynamic shopping carts, and continue through the checkout process. This was accomplished through a bootstrap front-end paired with a python backend with associated database for storage of persistent data. Some screenshots of our website are shown below:

        <p class="card-text">Digital Brown Bag was my most recent NMIX class. While this class was seminar based, it had a very large impact on me. My whole academic career has been about how to do the job; This was the first class that discussed everything AROUND the job. <br>Learning how to manage my credit score and determining my benefits are skills that I would have gone into adulthood not knowing had it not been for this class. Hearing from each speaker gave me a fresh perspective about the different career options available to me, and how to chase after them! <br>Every assignment in this class was focused on ME and MY career development.
